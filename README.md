This is an app mobile that is used to search details about a specific movie using the OMBD API. The app is structured in 3 scripts(index.html, main.js and movie.html).
Index.html- is the main page. It creates the interface which is formed by a search input and the part where the results are displayed. For instance if I want to see information about the movie, Titanic, I write 'titanic' on the search , I press enter and a list with the results is displayed. Then you click on the result you want, the moment when the phone vibrates, and another page is displayed when you cand see the poster and detailes of the movie. 

The app is based on Jquery Mobile. 
An issue with this app, which I want to resolve is that after every research you have to press back and refresh if you want to click on other choices.Otherwise, the option can't be clicked.
